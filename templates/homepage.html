if you feel so inclined):

    * An image of a melon.
    * A form for a user to fill in their name. This name input should be required (hint: there is an HTML required
    attribute that you can put on an input element. It won’t allow a form to submit until the required input has been
    filled out). The form should submit to /get-name using a GET request. -->#}
